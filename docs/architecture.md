# Architecture Overview of the Homelab Cloud Native Project

## Introduction
This document outlines the architecture design of the Homelab Cloud Native project, detailing the interaction between various components, data flow, and the overall layout of cloud-native technologies employed in the system.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Secret Management
- **Secret Manager**: A dedicated service for managing sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and tokens. This service will provide a mobile client for online editing of secrets, ensuring that sensitive data is securely stored and easily accessible.
- **Integration**: The secret manager will be integrated with Kubernetes to inject secrets into pods at runtime, ensuring that applications can access the necessary credentials without hardcoding them.

### 2. GitOps Principles
- **Version Control**: All deployment configurations and service definitions will be stored in a Git repository. This allows for versioning and easy rollback of configurations.
    - For stateless applications, deployed using [helm][2] and [argo cd][1]
    - For stateful applications, deployed using [OLM][3]
- **Continuous Deployment**: A CI/CD pipeline will be set up to automatically deploy changes to the Kubernetes cluster whenever updates are pushed to the repository. Tools like ArgoCD or Flux will be utilized to manage the deployment process, ensuring that the cluster state matches the desired state defined in Git.

### 3. Blue-Green Deployment
- **Deployment Strategy**: The architecture will support blue-green deployments, allowing for seamless transitions between application versions. This will minimize downtime and reduce the risk of introducing bugs into the production environment.
- **Traffic Management**: A service mesh (e.g., Istio or Linkerd) will be implemented to manage traffic routing between the blue and green environments, enabling easy switching and rollback if issues arise.

## Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**: Users will interact with the secret manager through a mobile client to manage sensitive information.
2. **Deployment Trigger**: Changes to the configuration files in the Git repository will trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
3. **Kubernetes Deployment**: The pipeline will apply the necessary manifests to the Kubernetes cluster, creating or updating resources as defined.
4. **Traffic Routing**: The service mesh will handle traffic routing to the appropriate version of the application, ensuring that users are directed to the correct environment.

## Conclusion
The architecture of the Homelab Cloud Native project is designed to leverage cloud-native technologies to provide a robust, scalable, and secure environment for deploying services. By adhering to GitOps principles, implementing a secret management solution, and utilizing blue-green deployment strategies, the project aims to ensure high availability and maintainability of services in a home lab setting.
