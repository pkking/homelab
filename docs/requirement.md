# Homelab Cloud Native Project Requirements

## Core Requirements

1. **Secret Management**:
   - All sensitive information must be managed using a secret manager.
   - The secret manager should provide an online editing service for secrets.
   - A mobile client must be available to edit secrets on the go.

2. **GitOps Principles**:
   - The deployment and configuration of all services must adhere to GitOps principles.
   - All configurations should be stored in a version-controlled repository to facilitate easy reconstruction of the entire cluster.
   - Changes to the infrastructure and applications should be made through pull requests to ensure traceability and review.

3. **Blue-Green Deployment**:
   - The system must support blue-green deployment strategies.
   - This capability should allow for testing new versions of services without impacting production.
   - Rollback procedures must be in place to quickly revert to the previous version in case of issues.

## Additional Considerations

- Ensure that all components are designed to be cloud-native, leveraging containerization and orchestration.
- The architecture should be scalable to accommodate future growth and additional services.
- Monitoring and logging solutions should be integrated to provide insights into the system's performance and health.
- Documentation should be maintained to provide clear guidance on setup, usage, and troubleshooting for all components.
